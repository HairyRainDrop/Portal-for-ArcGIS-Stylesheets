Feel free to use these skeletons to override Esri defaults.

####Portal Homepage Folder

#####'banner' only edits the top banner of the page. 

- In Portal for ArcGIS go to: Organization > Settings > Home Page
  
- Set your background image to "No background", and in banner image go to "Custom design".
  
- In "Custom design" you will see a paper icon with '<>' on it. Click this icon.
  
- Paste your modified 'banner' code into the box. Click save. All done.

#####'organization_description' modifies both the gallery viewer and organization description.
	
- In Portal for ArcGIS go to: Organization > Settings > Home Page
  
- At the bottom of the of the page you will see "Organization description". Click the "Edit" button below it.
  
- A popup will open, and it should look familiar as it is the same as the "Custom design" one above.
  
- You will see a paper icon with '<>' on it. Click this icon.
  
- Paste your modified 'organization_description' code into the box. Click save. All done.

_Note: The "Organization description" loves to erase formatted code, so I would recommend copy and pasting from your text/code editor back into this section to get your formatting back before modififying anything._
